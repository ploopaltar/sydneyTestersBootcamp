####Session 4: Performance Testing with JMeter

This session will help you get started with JMeter (an opensource tool) for performance testing. 

This is a fairly vast topic and there is a lot to cover, so we will work our way through until time runs out. If there is enough interest in going deeper into Performance Testing, we will schedule another session on Performance Testing sometime early next year. 

Some things we'll cover are:
- Basic components/elements of Jmeter
- Record/Playback
- Editing and parameterizing your scripts
- Assertions
- Reading Test data from CSV files 
- Debugging your scripts
- Monitoring and analysing results
- etc

NOTE: This is more of a "Get started with Jmeter for performance testing" than a "Basics of Performance Testing". During the session, we will spend more time fiddling hands-on with Jmeter rather than talking about the basics of performance testing (which IMO is covered by the suggested reading material).

####Who will benefit from this session:

- You've always wanted to do some performance testing on your web-based project, but arent quite sure how to get started.

OR

- You have used other tools for performance testing and now want to try out Jmeter.
